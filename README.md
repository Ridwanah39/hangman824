# Hangman
## Table of Contents
### Description
This  project is a Python-based Hangman game where the user attempts to guess a randomly selected word from a predefined list. The player tries to guess the word within a certain amount of attempts. 
#### Aim
This project aims to practice working with lists, user input validation, conditionals, and Pythons's built-in modules such as random.
#### What I have Learned
In this project, I learned about:
- To practice Python programming concepts.
- To implement Object-Orientated Programming by using classes and methods.
- Structuring a Python project and working with basic Git operations.
- To build a simple console game where the users interact via text input.
- How to refactor code for clarity and maintainability.
### Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install any required Python libraries
### Usage Instructions 
**Objective**: Guess the word one letter at a time before you run out of lives.
- **How to Play**:
1. You will be shown a word in the form of underscores (`_`), each underscore representing a letter of the word.
2. Guess letters by typing one letter at a time when prompted.
3. If you guess correctly, the letter will replace the corresponding underscores.
4. If you guess incorrectly, you will lose a life.
5. You have 5 lives. The game ends when you either guess all the letters or lose all your lives.
